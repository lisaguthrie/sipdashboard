Our goal is to strengthen the home–school connection and empower families to reinforce SEL skills in ways that reflect their values, traditions, and lived experiences. To deepen SEL partnerships with families, we will: • Host SEL-focused learning opportunities during Open House, curriculum nights, and PTA meetings to build shared understanding of core SEL skills and practices. • Share family-friendly strategies and resources through newsletters, videos, and classroom updates to support SEL development at home. • Invite families to share what respect looks like in their family, helping students recognize diverse cultural expressions of kindness, responsibility, and care. • Encourage families to use movies, videos, and short stories that promote positive SEL messages, providing examples and recommendations to help spark meaningful conversations at home. • Offer opportunities for families to share how they celebrate important traditions, supporting cultural awareness, belonging, and identity development across the school community. • Provide platforms for families to share about their careers and areas of expertise, highlighting SEL skills such as teamwork, collaboration, resilience, and problem-solving in real-life contexts. Through these ongoing efforts, we aim to create a school culture where students feel understood, supported, and connected, and where families are valued as essential partners in nurturing social-emotional development.

Goal #1 (Math, All Grades, All Students): 70% of students will show typical or aggressive growth from Fall to Spring as measured by the FastBridge Mathematics screener by Spring 2026.
Focus Area: Numbers and Operations
Current Data: Data: In the period from Fall 2022-Spring 2023, the mean by grade for students measuring typical or aggressive growth for the school was 57%. Typical growth is defined as falling in the 40th to 75th percentile, and aggressive growth is defined as 75th percentile or higher based on FastBridge. This measure is produced by the Group Growth Report, measuring Fall to Spring, based on comparing students’ median growth rate to median growth rate of students in the same grade nationally who started at the same score. Update: In the Fall 2023-Spring 2024 period, the mean by grade for students measuring typical or aggressive growth for the school was 55%. Update in Fall 2024-Spring 2025, the mean by grade for students measuring typical or aggressive growth for the school was 52%. We are struggling with this goal. While the achievement rate on FastBridge for our school remains high with 85% of students meeting or exceeding expected scores on the assessment, growth with this tool is a challenge. It’s important to note that Classroom-based measures show higher growth. There is some doubt in the FastBridge measurement tool among staff. Rationale: We want all students to grow in their learning. By measuring growth rate, we can monitor the progress of both students who are already achieving at high levels and need challenge as well as students who need support and intervention to meet benchmarks ensuring that students are making personal

Goal #2 (ELA, All Grades, All Students): 75% of students will show typical or aggressive growth from Fall to Spring as measured by the FastBridge Reading screener Group Growth Report by Spring 2026.
Focus Area: Reading
Current Data: Data: In the period from Fall 2022-Spring 2023, the mean by grade level for students measuring typical or aggressive growth for the school was 67%. Typical growth is defined as falling in the 40th to 75th percentile and aggressive growth is defined as 75th percentile or higher on FastBridge. This measure is produced by the Group Growth Report, measuring Fall to Spring, based on comparing student’s median growth rate to median growth rate of students in the same grade nationally who started at the same score. Update: In the Fall 2023-Spring 2024 period, the mean by grade for students measuring typical or aggressive growth for the school was 54%. Update: In the Fall 2024-Spring 2025 period, the mean by grade for students measuring typical or aggressive growth for the school was 56%. We are struggling with this goal. While the achievement rate on FastBridge for our school remains high with 87% of students meeting or exceeding expected scores on the assessment, growth with this tool is a challenge. We’ve made small progress since last year. It’s important to note that Classroom-based measures show higher growth. There is some doubt about the FastBridge measurement tool among staff. Rationale: We want all students to grow in their learning. By measuring growth rate, we can monitor the progress of both students who are already achieving at high levels and need challenge as well as students who need support and intervention to meet benchmarks ensuring that students are making personal progress in their learning wherever they begin on the continuum. A growth measure is an important indicator of meeting the needs of all students. We are a high achieving school, and most students are meeting expected standards, but we want them to make a year’s growth even if they are already at standard.

Goal #3 (SEL, All Grades, All Students): 65% of students in grades 3-5 will respond favorably in the emotional regulation category as measured by the Panorama Survey in Spring 2026.
Focus Area: Emotional regulation
Current Data: In the Spring of 2025 60% of students responded favorably on Emotion Regulation as measured by Panorama. Dr. Richie Davidson (University of Wisconsin-Madison) speaks about ‘every behavioral intervention being a biological intervention’—and that a young person’s repeated experiences in school have the opportunity to be a powerful influence for the re- wiring of neural pathways that is necessary for habits to be built and sustained. Implementing and sustaining a consistent set of SEL practices helps stakeholders collaboratively create the climate and culture that’s vital for optimal learning and working conditions for students and adults (CASEL, 2024). While SEL alone will not solve longstanding and deep-seated inequities in the education system, it can help schools promote understanding, examine biases, reflect on and address the impact of racism, build cross-cultural relationships, and cultivate adult and student practices that close opportunity gaps and create a more inclusive school community. In doing so, schools can promote high-quality educational opportunities and outcomes for all students, irrespective of race, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation, and other differences. This requires that SEL is implemented with an explicit goal of promoting educational equity (CASEL, 2024).

School: Kamiakin Middle School (Middle School)
Goal #3 (SEL, All Grades, All Students): By May 2026, students’ general academic self-efficacy scores on the Panorama Survey will increase by at least 5% from the 2025 results, as measured by the Self-Efficacy domain. Self-efficacy is the belief in one’s ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task, significantly influencing motivation, behavior and personal achievement. It is essentially the confidence one has in their ability to influence events and control their environment. We want to provide our students with evidence that they have the ability to meet our high academic expectations.
Focus Area: Self-Efficacy
Current Data: Panorama Survey Data, Counselor Needs Assessment survey and Student Listening Session comments from 24-25 reveal this as a growth opportunity. Panorama: Trend Panorama survey data for the past years shows that we have not made the overall consistent positive progress that we have made in some of the other categories in recent years; such as supportive relationships, positive feelings, emotion regulation, social perspective taking. We started some professional development on self-efficacy in the 24-25 school year and did make significant (4% points) progress since the Fall 2024 survey. We want to build on this progress. Panorama data from Spring 2025 shows that this area continues to show the greatest gap with students who identify as Hispanic/Latino (of any race) and/or Black African American. These students combined self-report 25% less favorable self- efficacy as our other racial and ethnic groups. This area also contains the 3rd greatest disparity for our male and female students with our female students reporting a 9% less favorable response.

Goal #2 (Math, Grade 8, All Students): On the Spring 2026 Math Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA), 100% of 8th grade classes will demonstrate “above the proficiency standard” or “at/near the proficiency standard” on Target E: Define, Evaluate, and Compare Functions.
Focus Area: Functions
Current Data: Spring 2025 SBA Results – Math Target E, Grade 8 Mathematics Grade 8 – Class of 2029 3 out of 12 classes scored “above the proficiency standard”, 4 classes scored “at/near the proficiency standard”, and 6 classes scored “below the proficiency standard”. As a grade level, our performance on this target as compared to others was identified as an “area of weakness”. Additionally, the following classes showed that target was an “area of weakness” compared to the other targets: • 2 classes that scored “above the proficiency standard”, • 3 classes that scored “at/near the proficiency standard”, and • 5 of the classes that scored “below the proficiency standard”. Additional rationale for this focus: Functions form the foundation of algebraic thinking and are central to success in Algebra I and will be utilized in subsequent math courses. Strengthening students’ ability to define, evaluate, and compare functions supports the transition from arithmetic and proportional reasoning to more abstract reasoning about relationships and quantities. It also supports students identifying the connections between equations, tables, graphs, and descriptions of functions – skills required for modeling real-world situations and data interpretation.
Strategies:
 * Action: Algebra I team collaboration – planning and data teaming, including the development of common formative and summative assessment questions on functions 
   Measures: • Team meeting notes throughout the year include lesson design around functions, formative assessment results, and student misconceptions around functions. • Common assessment questions and student work connected to functions are analyzed collaboratively for each unit functions are taught or reviewed. • Documentation includes sharing of effective instructional strategies, instructional adjustments made, and intervention strategies.
 * Action: Supplementation of current curricula on functions in units containing: Functions, Linear Functions, Quadratic Functions, and Exponential Functions
   Measures: • Unit plans and/or lesson plans show the integration of additional lessons and tasks on functions in relevant units. • Informal and/or formal observations confirm the use of supplemental lessons and/or tasks.
 * Action: Explicitly teach and/or reteach functions in each of the following units using multiple representations (equations, tables, graphs, and function notation): Functions, Linear Function, Quadratic Function, and Exponential Functions
   Measures: • Lessons plans and informal and/or formal observations show multiple representations used to define, evaluate, and compare functions. • Student work displays evidence of learning tied to functions. • Informal and/or formal observations confirm the explicit teaching and/or reteaching of functions.

Goal #3 (SEL, All Grades, All Students): Student reported self-efficacy will increase 6%, from 54% to 60% (as measured by the Panorama Survey of Student SEL Competency & Well-Being Measures).
Focus Area: Self-Efficacy
Current Data: Self-efficacy is one’s belief in their ability to complete specific tasks. These beliefs directly shape how students approach learning. When students believe they will be successful, they are willing to attempt challenging tasks, take intellectual risks, persist through difficulty, and recover from setbacks. When students have low self-efficacy, even students who are capable avoid rigorous work and give up quickly. By intentionally building student self-efficacy, we will teach and empower students to approach their learning with confidence, embrace rigor, and grow into resilient self-directed learners.
Strategies:
 * Action: Self-efficacy lessons including mindset and skills will be embedded into Panther Time throughout the year.
   Measures: • Lesson slide decks are developed and scheduled by our Panther Time coordinator and provided to teachers.

School: Renaissance School of Arts and Reasoning (Middle School)
Goal #1 (ELA, Grade 8, All Students): As measured by the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA), the proficiency of 8th grade students will improve from ‘weak’ in the 2024-25 school year to ‘strong’ in the 2025-26 school year for Target 8, Informational Text: “Given an inference or conclusion, use explicit details and implicit information from the text to support the inference or conclusion provided.”
Focus Area: Literacy
Current Data: There are three targets on the 2024-25 SBA in which 8th grade students at RSAR achieved ‘weak’ proficiency, including Target 8. A weakly proficient score on this target indicates that students struggle to use details from a text to support an inference. Building this skill will help students understand what they read in all subjects, not just ELA. Moving from ‘weak’ to ‘strong’ proficiency will better prepare students for the tougher reading and thinking tasks they will face in high school.
Strategies:
 * Action: During novel studies in ELA, students will explain what details in the text help them infer about characters, themes, or events.
   Measures: ELA teachers will share brief samples of student responses or discussion notes to show that evidence-and-inference practice is happening consistently.
 * Action: Teachers will incorporate close-reading routines, such as annotating key details or identifying evidence, when working with informational texts.
   Measures: Teachers will periodically review and discuss student work to confirm that close- reading routines are effective across subject areas.
 * Action: Teachers will regularly model their thinking by “talking through” how they make an inference and choose supporting details, then guide students in practicing the same process.
   Measures: Teachers will review notes and student work to ensure think-alouds and guided practice are being used consistently.
Engagement Strategies: 

School: Renaissance School of Arts and Reasoning (Middle School)
Goal #2 (Math, Grade 6, All Students): To better prepare students for Algebra 1 as 7th or 8th graders, the percentage of 6th grade students earning scores of proficient or better on the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA) will improve from 61% in the 2024-25 school year to 75% in the 2025-26 school year.
Focus Area: Math Fluency to support Algebra Readiness
Current Data: Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBA) scores show 61% of 6th grade students showing scores of proficient or better in the 2024- 25 school year. FastBridge assessments reveal gaps in foundational math skills (e.g., multiplication, fractions). Struggles with basic fluency impact students’ ability to engage with more complex math concepts. Math anxiety is prevalent, and lack of fluency contributes to low confidence.
Strategies:
 * Action: Students will engage in weekly math fluency activities focused on core prerequisite skills.
   Measures: Teachers will maintain a weekly log of fluency activities; lesson plans will reflect integration.
 * Action: Students identified for additional support will participate in small-group math interventions during intervention periods.
   Measures: Intervention groups will be documented with attendance records and progress monitoring tools.
 * Action: Students will reflect monthly on their math fluency progress using math journals or digital goal- setting tools.
   Measures: Teachers will review journals quarterly; student reflections will be part of student-led conferences.
Engagement Strategies: The School Improvement Plan is shaped by ongoing feedback from families and teachers, who consistently identify writing fluency, math fluency, and emotional regulation as top areas of need for students in middle school. These insights directly inform the school’s goals and ensure that the plan reflects what matters most to our community. Math teachers will utilize three programs to engage families on math work, including XtraMath, ALEKS, and Big Ideas Math. All three platforms can be used to monitor student understanding and progress over time. Additionally, XtraMath generates reports and certificates which can be sent automatically to parents and teachers depending on user preferences. During student-led conferences, which are bi-annual, students will self-select math work that they are proud of to show to their families. They will discuss why they are proud of the work, the circumstances that helped them be successful, and how they could have improved upon the work if applicable.

School: Renaissance School of Arts and Reasoning (Middle School)
Goal #3 (SEL, All Grades, All Students): By the end of the school year, at least 85% of students will be able to identify at least four core emotions and demonstrate at least two self-regulation strategies, as measured by teacher checklists, SEL reflections, and student self-assessments.
Focus Area: Emotion Identification & Regulation
Current Data: Increase in behavioral referrals related to emotional outbursts and peer conflict. Student and teacher surveys indicate a need for more emotional regulation tools. Research supports that SEL improves academic success and school climate.
Strategies:
 * Action: Students will participate in weekly SEL lessons focused on emotional awareness and regulation strategies.
   Measures: Teachers will follow a scope and sequence for SEL instruction.
 * Action: The SPED classroom will include a calm space or self-regulation area where students can take breaks when needed.
   Measures: Usage will be tracked (informally or with reflection tools).
 * Action: Students will engage in regular emotional check-ins during advisory periods using visual tools like emotion thermometers or mood meters.
   Measures: Teachers will incorporate daily check- ins consistently.
Engagement Strategies: The School Improvement Plan is shaped by ongoing feedback from families and teachers, who consistently identify writing fluency, math fluency, and emotional regulation as top areas of need for students in middle school.

School: Rose Hill Middle School (Middle School)
Goal #1 (ELA, Grade 6, All Students): All 6th grade students will show growth in multiple target areas under Literacy Texts.
Focus Area: 6th grade ELA students Target 1-7 • Target 1: Citing textual evidence to support analysis and inferences • Target 2: Determining central ideas or themes and summarizing text • Target 3: Analyzing how individuals, events, and ideas develop • Target 4: Interpreting word meaning and tone • Target 5: Analyzing text structure and author’s craft • Target 6: Comparing texts and genres • Target 7: Integrating knowledge and ideas
Current Data: 6th-grade ELA teachers will focus on developing students’ reading comprehension skills, with a specific emphasis on literary texts utilizing both fiction and non-fiction genres. This instructional priority stems from SBA data (2024–2025), which revealed that it was a weaker section compared to others. The data further indicated that constructed-response and evidence- based reasoning questions related to literary passages were among the lowest-performing targets, particularly those assessing inference, theme development, and analysis of character and plot. Strengthening students’ ability to analyze and interpret literary texts is critical to ensuring overall reading proficiency and readiness for more complex literary analysis in upper grades. In addition, literary text comprehension supports broader literacy
Strategies:
 * Action: Students engage with their IEP and ML case manager to choose focus goals and then monitor progress over the course of the year
   Measures: IEP and ML case managers track student growth quarterly, engaging students in the process and helping them reflect on evidence of progress towards their goals.

School: Rose Hill Middle School (Middle School)
Goal #2 (Math, Grades 6-7, All Students): By intentionally focusing on concepts identified on the math SBA as opportunities for improvement in 6th and 7th grade math, students will have a stronger foundation heading into Algebra, which will lead to more success in Algebra whether students take it in 7th or in 8th grade.
Focus Area: 6th Grade – Target B: Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division to divide fractions by fractions. Target I: Develop understanding of statistical variability. 7th Grade – Target F: Solve real-life and mathematical problems involving angle measure, area, surface area, and volume Target G: Use random sampling to draw inferences about a population. Target I: Investigate chance processes and develop, use, and evaluate probability models
Current Data: SBA: Last year, 80% of 6th graders (an increase of 8% from the previous year) and 78% of 7th graders (an increase of 10% from the previous year) scored a Level 3 (Met Standard) or Level 4 (Exceeded Standard) on the Math SBA. This is worthy of celebration and evidence that last year’s focus on providing students opportunities to retake assessments after reteaching/re- learning has taken place between attempts, so that they will continue learning after assessments, learn from their mistakes, and move closer to mastery, had a positive impact on student achievement. Last year on the SBA, 6th graders were Above the Proficiency Standard on all Concept and Procedures “Targets”. However, in the previous year, Target B was identified as a weakness, and Target I was the only one that was “At/Near Proficiency Standard”, so it is worthy of focusing on these specific areas. Last year on the SBA, 7th graders had two targets, Target F and Target G where they were “At/Near Proficiency Standard”, and another that Above Standard but still identified as an “Area of Weakness”: Target I.
Strategies:
 * Action: Math teachers will engage in whole department

Specific actions are discussed and implemented as a result of these meetings.

School: Rose Hill Middle School (Middle School)
Goal #3 (SEL, All Grades, All Students): To build community, encourage teamwork, reinforce the school values of Safe, Kind, and Responsible and promote school spirit, our school will implement a House system. Students and staff will be assigned to one of six houses, each representing core values and school pride. Continued implementation of restorative practices across the continuum (affective statements, affective questions, small impromptu conversations, circles, formal conferences), especially the 80% that are proactive, community-building focused, will lead to a greater sense of belonging for students.
Focus Area: 6th, 7th, and 8th Grade
Current Data: A sense of belonging impacts student performance, attendance, peer relationships, and school culture. Each student will be assigned to a House (six different houses named for different sub-species of lions, our school mascot), with an even distribution of 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students per house. Students will be engaged in developing a house chant, motto, crest, and decorating their pod as they work collaboratively to create their house’s individual identity. Student leaders, “House Captains,” will be chosen to help lead the work. Houses will compete and earn points through house competitions (academic, behavior, and extracurricular activities), events, and meetings. Restorative Practices foster a greater sense of belonging by creating a supportive and inclusive environment where students feel valued and heard. These practices, such as restorative circles, encourage open dialogue and mutual respect among students and teachers, helping build strong relationships and a positive school climate. This approach promotes a sense of safety and belonging, which is critical for students’ emotional and academic development. In the Panorama Spring survey, 53% of students gave positive responses to questions related to a sense of belonging (15% of students gave negative responses and 32% gave neutral responses). This showed an increase in positive response rate in this category of 9% and a decrease in negative responses by 4% compared to the year before. While this is evidence that the
Strategies:

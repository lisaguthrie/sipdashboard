Progress will be monitored through classroom observations, referral documentation, staff survey responses, student leadership rosters and feedback surveys, and parent participation records.",

Implementing and sustaining a consistent set of SEL practices helps stakeholders collaboratively create the climate and culture that’s vital for optimal learning and working conditions for students and adults (CASEL, 2024). While SEL alone will not solve longstanding and deep-seated inequities in the education system, it can help schools promote understanding, examine biases, reflect on and address the impact of racism, build cross-cultural relationships, and cultivate adult and student practices that close opportunity gaps and create a more inclusive school community. In doing so, schools can promote high-quality educational opportunities and outcomes for all students, irrespective of race, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation, and other differences. This requires that SEL is implemented with an explicit goal of promoting educational equity (CASEL, 2024).",
